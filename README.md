Hey! I’m diving deep into the world of cybersecurity—learning by doing, breaking, and fixing things along the way. My interests include vulnerability management, network security, and incident response.
I enjoy tackling complex problems and turning them into practical learning experiences. This space is where I share what I’m building, learning, and improving.
